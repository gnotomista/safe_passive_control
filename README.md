# safe_passive_control
Controllers to ensure safety and passivity of dynamical systems

## Quick setup
```
git clone https://github.com/gnotomista/safe_passive_control.git
cd safe_passive_control
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Open MATLAB and execute one of the scripts listed below.

## Controllers
* `mrs2019.m`: script to execute the controller developed in the paper ["G. Notomista, X. Cai, J. Yamauchi, and M. Egerstedt. Passivity-Based Decentralized Control of Multi-Robot Systems With Delays Using Control Barrier Functions. *International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems*, 2019"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04801)
* `hfr2020.m`: script to execute the controller developed in the paper "G. Notomista and X. Cai. A Safety and Passivity Filter for Robot Teleoperation Systems. *International Workshop on Human-Friendly Robotics*, 2020"
